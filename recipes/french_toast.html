        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            French toast, known as pain perdu ("lost bread") in France, is a breakfast and brunch dish made with old bread slices that are soaked in a milk and egg mixture and fried until golden brown and crispy. Often served with fresh fruit and a glass of orange juice, French toast is one of America's favorite breakfast foods. 
            French toast is a dish of sliced bread soaked in beaten eggs and often milk or cream, then pan-fried. Alternative names and variants include eggy bread, Bombay toast, freedom toast, gypsy toast, and poor knights (of Windsor).
